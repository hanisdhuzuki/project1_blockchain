    #Integration Summary:

    The web UI communicates with the smart contract through function calls and transactions.
    The UI reads data from the smart contract using view functions to display fund balances and registered needy people.
    Transactions are used to perform actions like setting thresholds, donating funds, and withdrawing funds, which update the state of the smart contract.

    #Conclusion:

    The integration of the web user interface with the smart contract allows users to interact with the charity system easily and transparently on the blockchain.
    The application provides a user-friendly interface for admins, donators, and donatees to manage charity operations efficiently.
